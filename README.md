# Fairchain

A Go-based blockchain proof-of-concept designed as a modular foundation for fairness-oriented consensus research.

## What This Is

Fairchain is a minimal but real blockchain node written in Go. It implements Nakamoto-style proof-of-work as a baseline consensus mechanism, with a pluggable `consensus.Engine` interface designed so future agents can swap in identity-bound, ticket-based, sequential-work consensus without rewriting the node.

## What Is Implemented

- **Core types**: Hash, BlockHeader, Block, Transaction (UTXO-style), canonical binary serialization
- **Crypto**: Double-SHA256 hashing, Merkle root computation, compact bits/target conversion, chainwork calculation
- **Chain params**: Mainnet, testnet, and regtest network definitions with full parameterization
- **Consensus**: Pluggable `consensus.Engine` interface with baseline PoW implementation
- **Validation**: Block structure validation, coinbase rules, merkle root verification, duplicate tx rejection, subsidy enforcement, timestamp rules (median-11 and prev+1), difficulty retargeting
- **Genesis**: Configurable genesis block builder and PoW miner; reproducible from fixed inputs
- **Chain manager**: Tip tracking, block acceptance, orphan pool, basic reorg support
- **Storage**: Abstract `BlockStore`/`PeerStore` interfaces with bbolt implementation
- **Mempool**: Thread-safe transaction pool with admission control
- **Miner**: Block template builder, coinbase creation, nonce-iterating mining loop
- **P2P networking**: TCP peer connections, version handshake, self-connection detection, inventory-based gossip, block/tx propagation, initial block sync, peer address gossip
- **Peer discovery**: Seed peers from config, persistent peer store, reconnection logic
- **Wire protocol**: Deterministic binary message encoding (version, verack, ping/pong, inv, getdata, block, tx, getblocks, addr)
- **RPC API**: Local HTTP JSON API (getinfo, getblockcount, getbestblockhash, getpeerinfo, getblock, submitblock, getmempoolinfo)
- **CLI**: Command-line tool for querying node status
- **Tests**: 43 passing tests covering serialization, hashing, merkle roots, compact bits, genesis mining, block validation, chain operations, protocol encoding, and storage

## What Is Not Implemented Yet

- Full UTXO spend validation (coinbase-only for now)
- Script execution
- Wallet / key management
- Headers-first sync (uses simple block sync)
- Advanced peer scoring
- Identity registration transactions
- Epoch/ticket consensus
- VRF-based eligibility
- Sequential memory-hard proofs
- Reward damping
- Collateral-backed mining identities

## Build

```bash
make build
```

Produces three binaries in `bin/`:
- `fairchain-node` — the full node
- `fairchain-genesis` — genesis block mining tool
- `fairchain-cli` — CLI query tool

## Quick Start

### Mine a genesis block (informational)

```bash
bin/fairchain-genesis --network regtest
```

### Run a single regtest node with mining

```bash
make run-regtest
```

Or manually:

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/fairchain-regtest
bin/fairchain-node \
  --network regtest \
  --datadir /tmp/fairchain-regtest \
  --listen 0.0.0.0:19444 \
  --rpc 127.0.0.1:19445 \
  --mine
```

### Query node status

```bash
bin/fairchain-cli --rpc http://127.0.0.1:19445 getinfo
```

### Run a second node (connects to first)

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/fairchain-regtest2
bin/fairchain-node \
  --network regtest \
  --datadir /tmp/fairchain-regtest2 \
  --listen 0.0.0.0:19446 \
  --rpc 127.0.0.1:19447
```

To connect them, add `--seed-peers` or configure `seed_peers` in the config file pointing to the first node's listen address.

### Run tests

```bash
make test
```
