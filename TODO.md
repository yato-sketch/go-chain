- [x] Peer address gossip (addr)
- [x] Seen inventory caches to prevent rebroadcast storms
- [x] Per-peer known inventory tracking
- [x] Seed peers from config
- [x] Persistent peer store
- [x] Reconnection loop
- [x] Inbound/outbound connection limits
- [x] Tests: message encode/decode roundtrips

## Phase 3: Mining & Mempool (COMPLETE)

- [x] Mempool with thread-safe admission, deduplication, size limits
- [x] Deterministic transaction ordering for block templates
- [x] Block template builder (coinbase + mempool txs)
- [x] Mining loop with context cancellation
- [x] Nonce iteration with batch checking
- [x] Mined block submission through validation pipeline
- [x] RPC API: getinfo, getblockcount, getbestblockhash, getpeerinfo, getblock, submitblock, getmempoolinfo
- [x] CLI query tool

## Phase 4: Hardening & Testing (COMPLETE)

- [x] Chain manager with orphan pool and basic reorg
- [x] Chain integration tests (init, process, multi-block, duplicate, orphan)
- [x] Multi-node chaos test (10-node, 16 phases: network chaos + adversarial attacks)
- [x] Adversarial testing tool (bad nonce, bad merkle, duplicate, time-warp, orphan flood, inflated coinbase, empty block)
- [x] Stress test: rapid block production, kill/restart chaos, seed swaps
- [x] Fuzz testing for Block, Transaction, BlockHeader, VarInt, and wire protocol messages
- [x] Peer disconnect and reconnect resilience testing (kill/restart phases)
- [x] Chain reorg with competing forks (natural reorgs in chaos test)
- [x] Graceful shutdown: explicit ordered teardown with per-stage logging
- [x] Structured logging (log/slog) with --log-level flag (debug/info/warn/error)
- [x] Metrics collection skeleton: atomic counters for blocks, peers, reorgs, orphans, rejections + /metrics RPC endpoint

## Phase 5: UTXO & Transaction Validation

- [ ] UTXO set tracking (in-memory + persistent)
- [ ] Input validation: referenced UTXO exists and is unspent
- [ ] Output validation: no negative values, total input ≥ total output
- [ ] Fee calculation (input sum - output sum)
- [ ] Coinbase maturity enforcement
- [ ] Double-spend detection in mempool
- [ ] Transaction priority by fee rate
- [ ] Mempool eviction policy

## Phase 6: Future Fair-Consensus Extension Points

- [ ] Identity registration transaction type
- [ ] Identity store (pubkey → registration height, collateral)
- [ ] Epoch seed computation interface
- [ ] Per-identity ticket allocation interface
- [ ] VRF-based eligibility check interface
- [ ] Sequential memory-hard proof interface
- [ ] Reward damping function interface
- [ ] Collateral-backed mining identity lifecycle
- [ ] Consensus engine swap: PoW → fair-consensus
- [ ] Activation height gating for consensus upgrades

## Phase 7: Production Hardening

- [ ] Headers-first sync
- [ ] Checkpoint support
- [ ] Peer banning and scoring
- [ ] Rate limiting
- [ ] TLS for P2P connections (optional)
- [ ] Prometheus metrics endpoint
- [ ] Structured JSON logging
- [ ] Systemd service file
- [ ] Docker container
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline
